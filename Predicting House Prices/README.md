##  Predicting House Prices
## Data on house sales in King County to predict house prices
In this project we will:

      •	Explore simple, multiple, ridge and LASSO regression and predict house prices 
      •	Feature Engineering
      •	Turn the regression around to predict the input given the output
      •	Compare different models for predicting house prices in order to assess which model fits best.We will be using polynomial regression as a means to examine this topic.
      •	Use built-in graphlab functions to compute the regression weights (coefficients/parameters)
      •	Given the regression weights, predictors and outcome write a function to compute the Residual Sum of Squares
      •	Look at coefficients and interpret their meanings
      •	Evaluate multiple models via RSS

      •	Use matplotlib to visualize polynomial regressions
      •	Use matplotlib to visualize the same polynomial degree on different subsets of the data
      •	Use a validation set to select a polynomial degree
      •	Assess the final fit using test data

      •	Run ridge regression multiple times with different L2 penalties to see which one produces the best fit. 
      •	Use a pre-built implementation of regression (GraphLab Create) to run polynomial regression, this time with L2 penalty
      •	Use matplotlib to visualize polynomial regressions under L2 regularization
      •	Choose best L2 penalty using cross-validation.
      •	Assess the final fit using test data.

      •	Run LASSO with different L1 penalties.
      •	Choose best L1 penalty using a validation set.
      •	Choose best L1 penalty using a validation set, with additional constraint on the size of subset.
      •	Exploring the house data vs Crime rate of that town.-The house price in a town is correlated with the crime rate of that town. Low crime towns tend to be associated with higher house prices and vice versa.
