In this notebook we will use data on house sales in King County to predict house prices using simple (one input) linear regression. You will:

Use graphlab SArray and SFrame functions to compute important summary statistics
Write a function to compute the Simple Linear Regression weights using the closed form solution
Write a function to make predictions of the output given the input feature
Turn the regression around to predict the input given the output
Compare two different models for predicting house prices
In this notebook you will be provided with some already complete code as well as some code that you should complete yourself in order to answer quiz questions. The code we provide to complte is optional and is there to assist you with solving the problems but feel free to ignore the helper code and write your own.
