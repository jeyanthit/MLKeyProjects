Recommending songs
In this module, we focused on building recommender systems to find products, music and movies that interest users. We also built an exciting iPython notebook for recommending songs, which compared the simple popularity-based recommendation with a personalized model, and showed the significant improvement provided by personalization.

In this assignment, we are going to explore the song data and the recommendations made by our model. In the process, you are going to learn how to use one of the most important data manipulation primitives, groupby. These techniques will be important to building the intelligent application in your capstone project.

Follow the rest of the instructions on this page to complete your program. When you are done, instead of uploading your code, you will answer a series of quiz questions (see the quiz after this reading) to document your completion of this assignment. The instructions will indicate what data to collect for answering the quiz.
