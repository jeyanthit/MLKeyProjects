## Recommending songs
Building recommender systems to find products, music and movies that interest users. We also built an exciting iPython notebook for recommending songs, which compared the simple popularity-based recommendation with a personalized model, and showed the significant improvement provided by personalization.

In this project, we are going to explore the song data and the recommendations made by our model. 

#### Learning outcomes
    •	Execute song recommendation code with the iPython notebook
    •	Load and transform real, song data
    •	Build a song recommender model
    •	Use the model to recommend songs to individual users
    •	Use groupby to compute aggregate statistics of the data
