## Identifying safe loans with decision trees
   The LendingClub is a peer-to-peer leading company that directly connects borrowers and potential lenders/investors. In this notebook, we will build a classification model to predict whether or not a loan provided by LendingClub is likely to default.

Using SFrames to do some feature engineering.

    •	Train a decision-tree on the LendingClub dataset.
    •	Visualize the tree.
    •	Predict whether a loan will default along with prediction probabilities (on a validation set).
    •	Train a complex tree model and compare it to simple tree model.
    
## Exploring Ensemble Methods
   In this project, we will explore the use of boosting. 

      •	Train a boosted ensemble of decision-trees (gradient boosted trees) on the LendingClub dataset.
      •	Predict whether a loan will default along with prediction probabilities (on a validation set).
      •	Evaluate the trained model and compare it with a baseline.
      •	Find the most positive and negative loans using the learned model.
      •	Explore how the number of trees influences classification performance.
