## Identifying safe loans with decision trees
   The LendingClub is a peer-to-peer leading company that directly connects borrowers and potential lenders/investors. In this notebook, we will build a classification model to predict whether or not a loan provided by LendingClub is likely to default.

Used SFrames to do some feature engineering.

    •	Train a decision-tree on the LendingClub dataset.
    •	Visualize the tree.
    •	Predict whether a loan will default along with prediction probabilities (on a validation set).
    •	Train a complex tree model and compare it to simple tree model.
