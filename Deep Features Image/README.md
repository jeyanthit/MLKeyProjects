# Deep features for image retrieval

   In this module, we focused on using deep learning to create non-linear features to improve the performance of machine learning. We also saw how transfer learning techniques can be applied to use deep features learned with one dataset to get great performance on a different dataset. We also built an iPython notebooks for both image retrieval and image classification tasks on real datasets.

   In this project, we are going to build new image retrieval models and explore their results on different parts of our image dataset. These techniques will be used at the core of the intelligent application in your capstone project.

### Learning outcomes

    •	Execute image retrieval code with the iPython notebook
    •	Use the .sketch_summary() method to view statistics of data
    •	Load and transform real, image data
    •	Execute image retrieval code with the iPython notebook
    •	Build image retrieval models using nearest neighbor search and deep features
    •	Compare the results of various image retrieval models
    •	Use the .apply() and .sum() methods on SFrames to compute functions of the data


## Fitting Gaussian Mixture Models with EM
Also we will:
     
      •	implement the EM algorithm for a Gaussian mixture model
      •	apply your implementation to cluster images
      •	explore clustering results and interpret the output of the EM algorithm
