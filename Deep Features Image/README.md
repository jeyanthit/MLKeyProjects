Deep features for image retrieval
In this module, we focused on using deep learning to create non-linear features to improve the performance of machine learning. We also saw how transfer learning techniques can be applied to use deep features learned with one dataset to get great performance on a different dataset. We also built an iPython notebooks for both image retrieval and image classification tasks on real datasets.

In this assignment, we are going to build new image retrieval models and explore their results on different parts of our image dataset. These techniques will be used at the core of the intelligent application in your capstone project.

Follow the rest of the instructions on this page to complete your program. When you are done, instead of uploading your code, you will answer a series of quiz questions (see the quiz after this reading) to document your completion of this assignment. The instructions will indicate what data to collect for answering the quiz.
